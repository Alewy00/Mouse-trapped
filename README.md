 
 ## Overview
 
 I would like to create a mini zelda dungeon with small easy puzzles
 
 - User can see entire map (non-scrolling)
 
 -A running Timer to keep track of User Ranking
 
 
 ## Puzzle Explanation
 
 The character must escape the cage to win the game 
 
 - The puzzles consist of throwing cheese at buttons to move blocks into 2 forms
 
 1) Tile form (Character can move over block)
 
 2) Wall form (Character cannot move past block)
