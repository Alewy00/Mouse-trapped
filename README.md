 
 ## Overview
 
 I would like to create a mini zelda dungeon with small easy puzzles
 
 - User can see entire map (non-scrolling)
 
 - User cannot lose, but there is a Quit button
 
 
 ## Puzzle Explanation
 
 The character must collect 3 keys to win the game (player starts with the first key and a boulder)
 
 
 - The puzzles consist of clicking buttons to move blocks into 2 forms
 
 1) Tile form (Character can move over block)
 
 2) Wall form (Character cannot move past block)
 
 - The user can roll the boulder to pass puzzles
 
 ## Detailed walkthrough of puzzles
 
 Puzzle 1) 
 - Player shoots cheese at Green Button to bring block into **tile** form 
 - Player shoots cheese at Blue Button to bring block into **tile** form 
 - Player shoots cheese at Red Button to bring block into **tile** form
 - Player shoots cheese at Green Button again Since the 10 second timer has reverted the Green Block into **wall** form
 - Player shoots cheese at Pink Button to bring block into **tile** form
 - Now that all blocks are in **tile** form, the user can now progress to the bottom left corner of the map
 
 Puzzle 2) 
  (subject to change)
 - Player puts the green blocks in room 2 into tile form
 - Player rolls the boulder onto the green/pink button 
 - player can now retrieve the final key
